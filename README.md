SUMMARY OF THE FIVE ARTICLES

The articles covered topics like array methods, fuction, control flow statements, and loops


Array methods- Below are the various array methods:

Array length- The length property returns the length (size) of an array

Array toString() - The JavaScript method toString() converts an array to a string of (comma separated) array values.


Array pop() - The pop() method removes the last element from an array
Array push() - The push() method adds the last element from an array
Array shift() - The shift() method removes the first array element and "shifts" all other elements to a lower index
Array unshift() - The unshift() method adds a new element to an array (at the beginning), and "unshifts" older elements
Array delete() - Array elements can be deleted using the JavaScript operator delete. This leaves holes in the array. it is better to use pop() or shift ()
Array concat() - The concat() method creates a new array by merging (concatenating) existing arrays
Array flat() - The flat() method creates a new array with sub-array elements concatenated to a specified depth.
Array splice() - The splice() method adds new items to an array.

Array slice() - The slice() method slices out a piece of an array.




Function - A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
example- Function is called, the return value will end up in x
let x = myFunction(4, 3);

function myFunction(a, b) {
// Function returns the product of a and b
  return a * b;
}

Control Statement- In JavaScript, there are three main types of control flow statements:

if/else statements- If/else statements are used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true, and a different block of code if the condition is false.

The ifâ€¦else statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, another block of code can be executed.


switch statements - Switch statements are used to execute a block of code based on the value of a variable or expression.


loops. - Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times, based on a certain condition. There are two main types of loops in JavaScript: for loops and while loops.

while loops- 
A while loop simply repeats itself while something is true. Theoretically a while loop can loop forever. It continues until the condition is false.
